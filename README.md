## Movie-Recommendation-Recommender-Systems

Recommendation systems are a collection of algorithms used to recommend items to users based on information taken from the user. These systems have become ubiquitous and can be commonly seen in online stores, movies databases and job finders.

In this project I explored how to predict and recommend movies based on the input users profile (content based recommender systems) and groups of similar users to them (collaborative filtering recommender systems).
